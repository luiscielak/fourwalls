### [Meet the 9 Interior Designers Who Are Changing How Philly Looks Right Now](https://www.phillymag.com/property/philadelphia-interior-designers/)



**The Laid-Back Industrialist:** Soné Ehabé

_Owner of 4Walls Interior Design, Kensington_

**How you know her:** The commercial portfolio of this 36-year-old up-and-comer is small but mighty: the renovations of four [Benjamin Lovell Shoes locations](../project/benjamin-lovell-shoes), and the Western-tinged cool of [Noble Bear Salon](../project/noble-bear-salon), arguably Ambler’s most stylish spot.

**What she loves now:** Different shades of green.

**What she’s over:** Glass tile backsplashes and shiny cabinets.

**Favorite material to work with:** Wood. “I love that you can cut one piece in a different way and it takes on a totally different feel, and that each species takes stain a different way.”

**Go-to source list:** Provenance for architectural elements, City Planter and Stump for greenery, and Garden State Tile for tile.

**What she’s working on:** A boutique nail salon at 6th and South and a speakeasy-style restaurant in Ventnor.
