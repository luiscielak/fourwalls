Using design to empower the people within it to create, grow and prosper. Inspiring growth and positive change through the innovative design. Being fully conscious
Contentious living and working spaces.

The other day I was asked why I love using vintage pieces and reclaimed material in the spaces I design. It’s so important to me to create an experience and tell a story. Reclaimed and vintage pieces have so much history that they create an additional layer of depth and Individuality newer pieces can’t compete with.

## Soné Ehabé

Soné's interior designs draw clientele from retail, restaurants & boutique hotels in Philadelphia and beyond. The spaces she designs encompass the people inhabiting them which allows for a certain design freedom that isn’t restrained by passing trends or a particular style. Spaces that tell a story that create the blueprint for a room that highlights integrity and character.
