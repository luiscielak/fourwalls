> "I was introduced to Sone and it was a huge pivot point for me. I knew after our first meeting that she wasn’t just a _designer_ that she was an incredibly intelligent, fellow business owner who’s confidence instantly allowed me to know I was in the right hands.
> I came to know as weeks went on how incredibly varied her background, set of skills and expertise were….
> I would recommend Sone to anyone, for any project. Be it your home or business. You are lucky if you get to have her by your side as you build your dream."
